# ZTM-AoC-2022-Solutions

In this repository I will (attempt to) post my solutions to all 24 days of the Zero To Mastery's Advent of Code 2022 challenge.

Day 1 [X] - Added two days late. Answer checked with the website and it works out. Attempted to make the most descrpitive solution as possible.

Day 2 [X] - Added a day late. Answer checked and works. The solution is not the prettiest by I couldn't really be bothered to try and make it less jarring. If it works it works
