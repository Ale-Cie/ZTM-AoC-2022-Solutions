# ZTM-AoC-2022-Solutions

In this repository I will (attempt to) post my solutions to all 24 days of the Zero To Mastery's Advent of Code 2022 challenge.

Day 1 [X] - Added two days late. Answer checked with the website and it works out. Attempted to make the most descrpitive solution as possible.

Day 2 [X] - Added a day late. Answer checked and works. The solution is not the prettiest by I couldn't really be bothered to try and make it less jarring. If it works it works

Day 3 [X] - Done in time. Answers checked. Pretty fun one not gonna lie.

Day 4 [X] - Done and early at that! Answers check out. This one right up my alley since splitting strings is something I find quite enjoyable.

Day 5 [X] - Done a bit late (at least in my time zone). This one was a hassle, not because it's difficult but because the whole day was a scheduling disaster. Anyway - onto the next challenge.

Day 6 [X] - Completed well within a time limit. Nice one, simple and fun to complete. Decided to do it with sets, since they make working with unique characters a breeze.
