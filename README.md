# ZTM-AoC-2022-Solutions

In this repository I will (attempt to) post my solutions to all 24 days of the Zero To Mastery's Advent of Code 2022 challenge.

Day 1 [X] - Added two days late. Answer checked with the website and it works out. Attempted to make the most descrpitive solution as possible.

Day 2 [X] - Added a day late. Answer checked and works. The solution is not the prettiest by I couldn't really be bothered to try and make it less jarring. If it works it works

Day 3 [X] - Done in time. Answers checked. Pretty fun one not gonna lie.

Day 4 [X] - Done and early at that! Answers check out. This one right up my alley since splitting strings is something I find quite enjoyable.

Day 5 [X] - Done a bit late (at least in my time zone). This one was a hassle, not because it's difficult but because the whole day was a scheduling disaster. Anyway - onto the next challenge.

Day 6 [X] - Completed well within a time limit. Nice one, simple and fun to complete. Decided to do it with sets, since they make working with unique characters a breeze.

Day 7 [X] - Completed few hours past midnight. That one confused me for a long time, the first part at least. Couldn't figure out how to add up the file sizes...

Day 8 [X] - Done, but due to work obligations could not be finished in time for day 8. I think the instructions could've been written a bit better, but none the less the program works so I'm happy.

Day 9 [X] - Again, work obligations made me publish this solution late. Weird, it wasn't that hard in the end but it gave me some trouble after all.

Day 10 [] - WIP
